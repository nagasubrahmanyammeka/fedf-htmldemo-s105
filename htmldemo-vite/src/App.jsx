        <p>I'm ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI based on the GPT-4o architecture. I can understand and generate human-like text, help write and debug code, assist with data analysis, answer questions across a wide range of subjects, and even interpret images.</p> <p>I’ve been trained on diverse datasets that include books, articles, websites, and code up until June 2024, allowing me to assist with both general knowledge and specialized tasks. While I don’t have feelings or personal experiences, I can simulate helpful, informative, and conversational responses to support you in learning, problem-solving, and creative work.</p>
